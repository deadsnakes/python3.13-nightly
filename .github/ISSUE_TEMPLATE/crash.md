about: A hard crash of the interpreter, possibly with a core dump
labels: "type-crash"

<!--
  This form is for hard crashes of the Python interpreter, segmentation faults,
  failed C-level assertions, and similar.
  Exceptions unexpectedly raised from stdlib Python functions
  count as bugs rather than crashes.

  The CPython interpreter is written in a different programming language, C.
  A "CPython crash" is when Python itself fails, leading to a traceback in the C stack.
