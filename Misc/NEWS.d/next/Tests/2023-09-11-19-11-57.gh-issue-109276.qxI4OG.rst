libregrtest now calls :func:`random.seed()` before running each test file
when ``-r/--randomize`` command line option is used. Moreover, it's also
called in worker processes.  It should help to make tests more
deterministic. Previously, it was only called once in the main process before
running all test files and it was not called in worker processes.  Patch by
Victor Stinner.
