Fix a bug in Argument Clinic that generated incorrect code for methods with
no parameters that use the :ref:`METH_METHOD | METH_FASTCALL | METH_KEYWORDS
<METH_METHOD-METH_FASTCALL-METH_KEYWORDS>` calling convention. Only the
positional parameter count was checked; any keyword argument passed would be
silently accepted.
