It is now possible to deprecate passing parameters positionally with
Argument Clinic, using the new ``* [from X.Y]`` syntax.
(To be read as *"keyword-only from Python version X.Y"*.)
See `documentation in the Python Developer's Guide
<https://devguide.python.org/development-tools/clinic/#clinic-howto-deprecate-positional>`__
for more information.
Patch by Erlend E. Aasland with help from Alex Waygood,
