Merge the Tier 1 (bytecode) and Tier 2 (micro-ops) interpreters together,
moving the Tier 2 interpreter loop and switch into
``_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()`` in ``Python/ceval.c``.
The ``Python/executor.c`` file is gone.
Also the ``TIER_ONE`` and ``TIER_TWO`` macros are now handled
by the code generator.

**Beware!** This changes the environment variables to enable micro-ops and
their debugging to ``PYTHON_UOPS`` and ``PYTHON_LLTRACE``.
