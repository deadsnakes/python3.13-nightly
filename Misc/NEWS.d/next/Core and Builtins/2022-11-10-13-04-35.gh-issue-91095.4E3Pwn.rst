Specializes calls to most Python classes. Specifically, any class that
inherits from ``object``, or another Python class, and does not override
``__new__``.

The specialized instruction does the following:

1. Creates the object (by calling ``object.__new__``)
2. Pushes a shim frame to the frame stack (to cleanup after ``__init__``)
3. Pushes the frame for ``__init__`` to the frame stack

Speeds up the instantiation of most Python classes.
