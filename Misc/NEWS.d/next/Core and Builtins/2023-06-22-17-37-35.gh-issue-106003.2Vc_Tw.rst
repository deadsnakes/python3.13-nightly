Add a new :opcode:`TO_BOOL` instruction, which performs boolean conversions
for :opcode:`POP_JUMP_IF_TRUE`, :opcode:`POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE`, and
:opcode:`UNARY_NOT` (which all expect exact :class:`bool` values now). Also,
modify the oparg of :opcode:`COMPARE_OP` to include an optional "boolean
conversion" flag.
