Make interp->obmalloc a pointer. For interpreters that share state with the
main interpreter, this points to the same static memory structure. For
interpreters with their own obmalloc state, it is heap allocated. Add
free_obmalloc_arenas() which will free the obmalloc arenas and radix tree
structures for interpreters with their own obmalloc state.
