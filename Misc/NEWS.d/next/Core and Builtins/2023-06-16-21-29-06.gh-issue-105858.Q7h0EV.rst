Improve the constructors for :mod:`ast` nodes. Arguments of list types now
default to an empty list if omitted, and optional fields default to ``None``.
AST nodes now have an
``__annotations__`` attribute with the expected types of their attributes.
Passing unrecognized extra arguments to AST nodes is deprecated and will
become an error in Python 3.15. Omitting a required argument to an AST node
is deprecated and will become an error in Python 3.15. Patch by Jelle
Zijlstra.
