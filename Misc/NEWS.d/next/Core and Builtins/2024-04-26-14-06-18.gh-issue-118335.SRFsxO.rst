Change how to use the tier 2 interpreter. Instead of running Python with
``-X uops`` or setting the environment variable ``PYTHON_UOPS=1``, this
choice is now made at build time by configuring with
``--enable-experimental-jit=interpreter``.

**Beware!** This changes the environment variable to enable or disable
micro-ops to ``PYTHON_JIT``. The old ``PYTHON_UOPS`` is no longer used.
