Added a new, experimental, tracing optimizer and interpreter (a.k.a. "tier 2"). This currently pessimizes, so don't use yet -- this is infrastructure so we can experiment with optimizing passes. To enable it, pass ``-Xuops`` or set ``PYTHONUOPS=1``. To get debug output, set ``PYTHONUOPSDEBUG=N`` where ``N`` is a debug level (0-4, where 0 is no debug output and 4 is excessively verbose).
