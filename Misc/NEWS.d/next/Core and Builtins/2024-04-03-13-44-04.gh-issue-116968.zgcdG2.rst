Introduce a unified 16-bit backoff counter type (``_Py_BackoffCounter``),
shared between the Tier 1 adaptive specializer and the Tier 2 optimizer. The
API used for adaptive specialization counters is changed but the behavior is
(supposed to be) identical.

The behavior of the Tier 2 counters is changed:

* There are no longer dynamic thresholds (we never varied these).
* All counters now use the same exponential backoff.
* The counter for ``JUMP_BACKWARD`` starts counting down from 16.
* The ``temperature`` in side exits starts counting down from 64.
