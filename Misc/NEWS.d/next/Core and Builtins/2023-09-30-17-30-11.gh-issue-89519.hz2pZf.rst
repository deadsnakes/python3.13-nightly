Removed chained :class:`classmethod` descriptors (introduced in
:issue:`19072`).  This can no longer be used to wrap other descriptors such
as :class:`property`.  The core design of this feature was flawed and caused
a number of downstream problems.  To "pass-through" a :class:`classmethod`,
consider using the :attr:`!__wrapped__` attribute that was added in Python
3.10.
