Add :c:func:`PyDict_SetDefaultRef`: insert a key and value into a dictionary
if the key is not already present. This is similar to
:meth:`dict.setdefault`, but returns an integer value indicating if the key
was already present. It is also similar to :c:func:`PyDict_SetDefault`, but
returns a strong reference instead of a borrowed reference.
