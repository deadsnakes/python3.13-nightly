Remove the old aliases to functions calling functions which were kept for
backward compatibility with Python 3.8 provisional API:

* ``_PyObject_CallMethodNoArgs()``: use ``PyObject_CallMethodNoArgs()``
* ``_PyObject_CallMethodOneArg()``: use ``PyObject_CallMethodOneArg()``
* ``_PyObject_CallOneArg()``: use ``PyObject_CallOneArg()``
* ``_PyObject_FastCallDict()``: use ``PyObject_VectorcallDict()``
* ``_PyObject_Vectorcall()``: use ``PyObject_Vectorcall()``
* ``_PyObject_VectorcallMethod()``: use ``PyObject_VectorcallMethod()``
* ``_PyVectorcall_Function()``: use ``PyVectorcall_Function()``

Just remove the underscore prefix to update your code. Patch by Victor
Stinner.
