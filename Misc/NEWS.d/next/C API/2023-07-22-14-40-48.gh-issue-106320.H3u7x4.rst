Remove private ``_PyUnicode_AsString()`` alias to
:c:func:`PyUnicode_AsUTF8`. It was kept for backward compatibility with
Python 3.0 - 3.2. The :c:func:`PyUnicode_AsUTF8` is available since Python
3.3. The :c:func:`PyUnicode_AsUTF8String` function can be used to keep
compatibility with Python 3.2 and older. Patch by Victor Stinner.
