Add :c:func:`PyThreadState_GetUnchecked()` function: similar to
:c:func:`PyThreadState_Get()`, but don't kill the process with a fatal error if
it is NULL. The caller is responsible to check if the result is NULL.
Previously, the function was private and known as
``_PyThreadState_UncheckedGet()``. Patch by Victor Stinner.
