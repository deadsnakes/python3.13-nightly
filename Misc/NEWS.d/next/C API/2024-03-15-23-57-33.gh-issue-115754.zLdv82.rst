In the limited C API version 3.13, getting ``Py_None``, ``Py_False``,
``Py_True``, ``Py_Ellipsis`` and ``Py_NotImplemented`` singletons is now
implemented as function calls at the stable ABI level to hide implementation
details. Getting these constants still return borrowed references. Patch by
Victor Stinner.
