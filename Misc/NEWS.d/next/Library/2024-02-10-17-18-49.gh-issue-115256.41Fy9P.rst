Added DeprecationWarning when accessing the tarfile attribute of TarInfo
objects. The attribute is never used internally and is only attached to
TarInfos when the tarfile is opened in write-mode, not read-mode. The
attribute creates an unnecessary reference cycle which may cause
corruption when not closing the handle after writing a tarfile.
