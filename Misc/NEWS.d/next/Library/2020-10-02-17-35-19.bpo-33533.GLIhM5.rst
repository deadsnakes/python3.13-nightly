:func:`asyncio.as_completed` now returns an object that is both an asynchronous
iterator and plain iterator. The new asynchronous iteration pattern allows for
easier correlation between prior tasks and their completed results. This is
a closer match to :func:`concurrent.futures.as_completed`'s iteration pattern.
