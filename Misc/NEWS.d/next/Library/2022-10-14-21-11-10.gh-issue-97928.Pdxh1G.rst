Change the behavior of :meth:`tkinter.Text.count`. It now always returns an
integer if one or less counting options are specified. Previously it could
return a single count as a 1-tuple, an integer (only if option ``"update"``
was specified) or ``None`` if no items found. The result is now the same if
``wantobjects`` is set to ``0``.
