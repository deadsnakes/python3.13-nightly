Partially revert the behavior of :meth:`tkinter.Text.count`. By default it
preserves the behavior of older Python versions, except that setting
``wantobjects`` to 0 no longer has effect. Add a new parameter *return_ints*:
specifying ``return_ints=True`` makes ``Text.count()`` always returning the
single count as an integer instead of a 1-tuple or ``None``.
