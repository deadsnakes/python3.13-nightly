Change :mod:`compileall` to only strip the stripdir prefix from the full path
recorded in the compiled ``.pyc`` file, when the prefix matches the start of
the full path in its entirety. When the prefix does not match, no stripping is
performed and a warning to this effect is displayed.

Previously all path components of the stripdir prefix that matched the full
path were removed, while those that did not match were left alone (including
ones interspersed between matching components).
