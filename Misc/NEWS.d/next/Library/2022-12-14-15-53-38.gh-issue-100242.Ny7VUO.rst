Bring pure Python implementation ``functools.partial.__new__`` more in line
with the C-implementation by not just always checking for the presence of
the attribute ``'func'`` on the first argument of ``partial``. Instead, both
the Python version and the C version perform an ``isinstance(func, partial)``
check on the first argument of ``partial``.
