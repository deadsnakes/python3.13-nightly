Refreshed zipfile._path from `zipp 3.18
<https://zipp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html#v3-18-0>`_, providing
better compatibility for PyPy, better glob performance for deeply nested
zipfiles, and providing internal access to ``CompleteDirs.inject`` for use
in other tests (like importlib.resources).
