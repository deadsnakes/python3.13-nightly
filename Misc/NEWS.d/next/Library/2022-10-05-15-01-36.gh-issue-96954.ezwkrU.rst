Switch the storage of the unicode codepoint names to use a different
data-structure, a `directed acyclic word graph
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton>`_.
This makes the unicodedata shared library about 440 KiB smaller. Contributed by
Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick using code from the PyPy project.
