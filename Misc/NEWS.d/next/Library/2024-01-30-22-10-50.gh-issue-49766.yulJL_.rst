Fix :class:`~datetime.date`-:class:`~datetime.datetime` comparison. Now the
special comparison methods like ``__eq__`` and ``__lt__`` return
:data:`NotImplemented` if one of comparands is :class:`!date` and other is
:class:`!datetime` instead of ignoring the time part and the time zone or
forcefully return "not equal" or raise :exc:`TypeError`. It makes comparison
of :class:`!date` and :class:`!datetime` subclasses more symmetric and
allows to change the default behavior by overriding the special comparison
methods in subclasses.
