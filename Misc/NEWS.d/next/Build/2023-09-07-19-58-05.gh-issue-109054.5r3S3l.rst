Fix building the ``_testcapi`` extension on Linux AArch64 which requires
linking to libatomic when ``<cpython/pyatomic.h>`` is used: the
``_Py_atomic_or_uint64()`` function requires libatomic
``__atomic_fetch_or_8()`` on this platform. The configure script now checks
if linking to libatomic is needed and generates a new LIBATOMIC variable
used to build the _testcapi extension. Patch by Victor Stinner.
